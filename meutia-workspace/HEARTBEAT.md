# HEARTBEAT.md

# Admin & coordination heartbeat — keep lightweight.

# Add active tasks below when you have something in progress.

## Active Tasks

_(empty — add tasks here when working on client coordination or admin)_

## Periodic Checks (rotate 1-2x per day)

- Any new client inquiries or follow-up requests in inbox?
- Any pending tasks from Captain that need routing to Rangers?
- Any Ranger task updates to relay back to Captain or clients?
- Calendar: any upcoming meetings or deadlines in next 24-48h?

## Notes

- Only reach out proactively if there's a genuine need (urgent client matter, task blocked, deadline approaching)
- Late night WIB (23:00-08:00): stay quiet unless urgent
- Keep your topic in cuk_rangers clean — post updates, not raw dumps
